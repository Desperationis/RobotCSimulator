# RobotCSimulator (WIP)
![Preview Image](/Images/Capture.PNG)
RobotCSimulator is a basic robot simulation that runs RobotC code with the aid of [RobotCConverter](https://github.com/Desperationis/RobotCConverter).

## What it can do
RobotCSimulator can do the following:
* Show motor changes in real-time using a virtual robot avatar.
* Use a PS4 controller as a VexNET controller.
* Display motor values, sensor values, and power vs time graph of the motors.

## How to use
To use RobotCSimulator, simply run [RobotCConverter](https://github.com/Desperationis/RobotCConverter) with it's output directory headed for RobotCSimulator/Source/ROBOTC/Program, and compile the code using Visual Studio 2019.
